               <p className="text-sm">
                The work of the BHNI is based on the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their Additional Protocols, the Statutes of the BHNI and Blissful Health Nigeria Initiative The BHNI is an impartial, neutral and independent organization whose exclusively humanitarian mission is to protect the lives and dignity of victims of armed conflict and other situations of violence and to provide them with assistance. Safeguarding the personal data of individuals is an essential aspect of protecting people's lives, dignity and bodily integrity â€“ which makes it a matter of fundamental importance for us. Data protection touches on all areas of the ICRC's activities, including our fundraising work. In light of this, the ICRC adopted the ICRC Rules on Personal Data Protection. We at REM have incorporated these rules into our daily work. They ensure that we carry out our activities in accordance with internationally recognized standards for protecting personal data. You can rest assured that we will take all reasonable steps to protect your privacy.

In the course of our relationship with you, we will be processing your personal data under certain circumstances, as explained below. If we did not process your personal data, we would not be able to provide the services you request or accept your donations.

               <p className="text-sm">
                 When you choose to contribute to the ICRC financially, we process your personal data in order to administer your donation, together with our payment providers or banks. In order to comply with certain legal requirements, we are obliged to ensure that donations from supporters and partners above a certain threshold are in line with the ICRC's ethical principles and do not contradict the Fundamental Principles of the Movement. If this is not the case, the donation will be rejected. To gain a full understanding of whether all ethical criteria are met and to assess risks associated with receiving the different forms of support, eligible supporters/partners and donations made above a certain threshold, whether from potential private supporters or from partners (both companies and foundations), are subject to an ethical screening process, which draws on reliable internal and external (i.e. public) sources. When we process your personal data in such a context, we do so only to administer your donation and fulfil our legal and ethical requirements with regard to fundraising. When the ICRC processes your personal data in relation to the examination of proposed gifts, it is always in accordance with the legitimate interests of the ICRC, which require processing of such data. The personal data we process are: the information you provide alongside your donation, such as your title, first and last names, country of residence, postal address, phone number and email address information we receive in the course of your payment, such as bank details the information we receive from external service providers, such as information that may indicate a conflict of interest. We may need to share some information with external service providers that help us deliver the services you have requested, such as payment providers. We may also need to share some of the information with external service providers that monitor the sources of proposed contributions in support of the ICRC. Wherever possible, the ICRC relies on internal resources to assess the risks associated with receiving support from potential supporters and partners. Where necessary, the ICRC also consults reliable external sources. The information shared will be used solely for the purpose of providing the services requested. We only share personal data with National Societies where it is reasonable and necessary to accomplish the purpose of your interaction with us or to develop our relationship. While we may share the outcome of the ethical screening process with National Societies (i.e. whether the donation is accepted or not), we do not share our analysis or its source materials.

               <p className="text-sm">
                In order to widen our circle of supporters and partners, we reach out to individuals that we think may be interested in our mission and want to help fund our work. To gain a full understanding of the individuals, companies or foundations that may want to support our humanitarian movement, we draw on external sources, but only when we have compelling reason to believe that this adds valuable information to help us grow our circle of supporters and partners. Sometimes, we may also receive personal data from third-party suppliers that indicate you might have an interest in supporting us. The purpose of processing your personal data in such a context is, therefore, to widen the circle of supporters and partners of the ICRC, to strengthen the exclusively humanitarian mission of the ICRC and to ensure compliance with the ICRC's ethical principles. When the ICRC processes your personal data in relation to our efforts to widen our circle of supporters and partners, we do so only in accordance with our legitimate interest in strengthening our humanitarian movement with the backing of our supporters and partners. The personal data we process are: contact details, such as your title, first and last names, country of residence, postal address, phone number and email address the information we receive from external service providers, such as any information that may indicate you have an interest in supporting our humanitarian movement, for example your previous engagement in fundraising, your background, your career or your interests. We may need to share some information with external service providers that help us meet our goals, as set out above, and help us monitor the sources of proposed contributions. The information shared will be used solely for the purpose of providing the services requested.

Additionally, in order to uphold and protect our principled humanitarian action, all charitable bequests to the ICRC must comply with strict ethical principles â€“ otherwise, they will be rejected. To know whether all criteria have been met, we need to make sure that eligible contributions above a certain threshold (cash, in-kind donations, estate, etc.) from potential private supporters and partners (individuals, companies, foundations, etc.) comply with our legal obligations and do not contradict our Fundamental Principles. Wherever possible, we rely on internal resources to assess the risks associated with receiving support from potential supporters. Where necessary, we also consult reliable external sources. Whenever we process your personal data in relation to any gift or contribution, we do so only on the basis of our legitimate interest in strengthening our humanitarian movement with the backing and generosity of our supporters and partners.

The information shared will be used by such service providers solely for the purpose of providing the services requested.
